# Memory Game
This is my first project for Per Scholas.

Game: A memory game in matching card format. Total of 50 cards.

Theme: Animal Crossing
## Description
This is a simple memory game where the player is given 40 attempts to match 25 sets of cards with the identical images. 

The player can flip two cards at a time. If player finds matching set of cards, the attempt will not be consumed. But, if two cards flipped are not matching, one attempt will be consumed.

If the player finds all cards, a winner's message will pop-up. If there are no more attempts left before finding all cards, a game-over message will pop-up.

- The box on the left will show a message of how many chances are left throughout the play.
- The play/pause button will play the main theme of the animal crossing. A player may pause the song by clicking the button.
- The reset button will reset the number of chances and flip cards back to their starting position. The order of the cards will be randomized.
